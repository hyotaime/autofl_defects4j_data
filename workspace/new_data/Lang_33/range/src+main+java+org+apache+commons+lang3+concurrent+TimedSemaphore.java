      "comment": "\n * \u003cp\u003e\n * A specialized \u003cem\u003esemaphore\u003c/em\u003e implementation that provides a number of\n * permits in a given time frame.\n * \u003c/p\u003e\n * \u003cp\u003e\n * This class is similar to the {@code java.util.concurrent.Semaphore} class\n * provided by the JDK in that it manages a configurable number of permits.\n * Using the {@link #acquire()} method a permit can be requested by a thread.\n * However, there is an additional timing dimension: there is no {@code\n * release()} method for freeing a permit, but all permits are automatically\n * released at the end of a configurable time frame. If a thread calls\n * {@link #acquire()} and the available permits are already exhausted for this\n * time frame, the thread is blocked. When the time frame ends all permits\n * requested so far are restored, and blocking threads are waked up again, so\n * that they can try to acquire a new permit. This basically means that in the\n * specified time frame only the given number of operations is possible.\n * \u003c/p\u003e\n * \u003cp\u003e\n * A use case for this class is to artificially limit the load produced by a\n * process. As an example consider an application that issues database queries\n * on a production system in a background process to gather statistical\n * information. This background processing should not produce so much database\n * load that the functionality and the performance of the production system are\n * impacted. Here a {@code TimedSemaphore} could be installed to guarantee that\n * only a given number of database queries are issued per second.\n * \u003c/p\u003e\n * \u003cp\u003e\n * A thread class for performing database queries could look as follows:\n *\n * \u003cpre\u003e\n * public class StatisticsThread extends Thread {\n *     // The semaphore for limiting database load.\n *     private final TimedSemaphore semaphore;\n *     // Create an instance and set the semaphore\n *     public StatisticsThread(TimedSemaphore timedSemaphore) {\n *         semaphore \u003d timedSemaphore;\n *     }\n *     // Gather statistics\n *     public void run() {\n *         try {\n *             while(true) {\n *                 semaphore.acquire();   // limit database load\n *                 performQuery();        // issue a query\n *             }\n *         } catch(InterruptedException) {\n *             // fall through\n *         }\n *     }\n *     ...\n * }\n * \u003c/pre\u003e\n *\n * The following code fragment shows how a {@code TimedSemaphore} is created\n * that allows only 10 operations per second and passed to the statistics\n * thread:\n *\n * \u003cpre\u003e\n * TimedSemaphore sem \u003d new TimedSemaphore(1, TimeUnit.SECOND, 10);\n * StatisticsThread thread \u003d new StatisticsThread(sem);\n * thread.start();\n * \u003c/pre\u003e\n *\n * \u003c/p\u003e\n * \u003cp\u003e\n * When creating an instance the time period for the semaphore must be\n * specified. {@code TimedSemaphore} uses an executor service with a\n * corresponding period to monitor this interval. The {@code\n * ScheduledExecutorService} to be used for this purpose can be provided at\n * construction time. Alternatively the class creates an internal executor\n * service.\n * \u003c/p\u003e\n * \u003cp\u003e\n * Client code that uses {@code TimedSemaphore} has to call the\n * {@link #acquire()} method in aach processing step. {@code TimedSemaphore}\n * keeps track of the number of invocations of the {@link #acquire()} method and\n * blocks the calling thread if the counter exceeds the limit specified. When\n * the timer signals the end of the time period the counter is reset and all\n * waiting threads are released. Then another cycle can start.\n * \u003c/p\u003e\n * \u003cp\u003e\n * It is possible to modify the limit at any time using the\n * {@link #setLimit(int)} method. This is useful if the load produced by an\n * operation has to be adapted dynamically. In the example scenario with the\n * thread collecting statistics it may make sense to specify a low limit during\n * day time while allowing a higher load in the night time. Reducing the limit\n * takes effect immediately by blocking incoming callers. If the limit is\n * increased, waiting threads are not released immediately, but wake up when the\n * timer runs out. Then, in the next period more processing steps can be\n * performed without blocking. By setting the limit to 0 the semaphore can be\n * switched off: in this mode the {@link #acquire()} method never blocks, but\n * lets all callers pass directly.\n * \u003c/p\u003e\n * \u003cp\u003e\n * When the {@code TimedSemaphore} is no more needed its {@link #shutdown()}\n * method should be called. This causes the periodic task that monitors the time\n * interval to be canceled. If the {@code ScheduledExecutorService} has been\n * created by the semaphore at construction time, it is also shut down.\n * resources. After that {@link #acquire()} must not be called any more.\n * \u003c/p\u003e\n *\n * @version $Id:$\n "
